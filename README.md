# `aiida-declarative`
This plugin exposes the `DeclarativeChain` to flexibly compose and execute [AiiDA](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core) `WorkChains` without the need to write any python code or explicitely register
it.
It is based around a very minimal declarative syntax formatted as `json` or `yaml` files, very similar to other workflow specifications like `github actions`.

## Demonstrating Example
The following is a very basic example, executing twice the `AddWorkChain` and gathering the sums:
```yaml
---
steps:
  - calcfunction: core.arithmetic.add
    inputs:
      x: 4
      y: 5
      code: bash@localhost
    postprocess:
      - "{{ ctx.current.outputs['sum']|to_ctx('sum') }}"
      - "{{ ctx.current.outputs['sum']|to_results('sum_1') }}"
  - calcfunction: core.arithmetic.add
    inputs:
      x: "{{ctx.sum}}"
      y: 5
      code: bash@localhost
    postprocess:
      - "{{ ctx.current.outputs['sum'] | to_results('sum_2') }}"
```

## Syntax
The overall structure of the input files are as follows:
```yaml
---
steps:
- calcjob: <aiida calcjob or calculation entry point>
  inputs:
    <dict with inputs for the calcjob>
```
The array of steps will be ran sequentially inside the workchain. The structure above is the most basic form of a workflow file.

### Data Referencing
To keep the files clean and readable, it is possible to first specify some data and then reference it in the `steps` part of the workflow file. For example:
```yaml
---
data:
    kpoints:
    - 6
    - 6
    - 6
steps:
- calcjob: quantumespresso.pw
  inputs:
    kpoints:
        "$ref": "#/data/kpoints"
    <other inputs>
```
will paste the definition of `kpoints` in the `data` section into the input where it's referenced. This uses [jsonref](https://pypi.org/project/jsonref/), see its documentation for more possibilities. It is for example also possible to reference data from an external json/yaml file.

### Explicit DataTypes
The `DeclarativeChain` uses the `specification` of the step to determine what AiiDA `DataNodes` to create for each of the inputs. In case that these are not explicitely written/known, a user can specify which datatype to construct as follows:
```yaml
inputs:
  <input_label>:
    value: <val>
    type: <datanode_entrypoint>
```
e.g.
```yaml
inputs:
  kpoints:
    value:
    - 6
    - 6
    - 6
    type: core.array.kpoints
```

### Jinja templates
Often, we want to use the workchain context `self.ctx` to store and retrieve intermediate results throughout the workchain's execution. To facilitate this we can use [jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/) templates such as:
`"{{ ctx.scf_dir }}"` to resolve certain values into the yaml script. The use of will become clear later.

### Setup
The top level `setup` statement allows for specifying some templates that will be executed before the main steps of the workchain.
This allows for the definition of context variables, e.g.
```yaml
---
setup:
- "{{ 1 | to_ctx('count') }}"
```
sets the `self.ctx.count` variable to `1`.

### PostProcessing
By defining a `postprocess` field, common operations can be performed that will run _after_ the execution of the `current` calcjob. For example
```yaml
---
data:
    <data>
steps:
- calcjob: quantumespresso.pw
  inputs:
    <inputs>
  postprocess:
  - "{{ outputs['remote_folder'] | to_ctx('scf_dir') }}"
- calcjob: quantumespresso.pw
  inputs:
    parameters:
        "$ref": "#/data/pw_parameters"
    parameters.CONTROL.calculation: nscf
    parent_folder: "{{ ctx.scf_dir }}"
```
Here we can observe a couple of new constructs. The first is `outputs`, signifying the outputs of the currently executed calcjob (i.e. the `scf` calculation). Secondly, the `|` and `to_ctx` in `"{{ outputs['remote_folder'] | to_ctx('scf_dir') }}"` means that the value is piped through a the `to_ctx` filter, which assigns it to the variable `scf_dir`, stored in the workchain's context `self.ctx` for later referencing. Indeed we see that in the next step we retrieve this value using `"{{ ctx.scf_dir }}"` as the `parent_folder` input. Finally we note the line `parameters.CONTROL.calculation: nscf`, this simply means that we set a particular value in the `parameters` dictionary.

### If
Steps can define an `if` field which contains a statement. If the statement is true, the step will be executed, otherwise it is ignored.
```yaml
---
steps:
- if: "{{ ctx.should_run }}"
  calcjob: quantumespresso.pw
  inputs:
    <inputs>
```
Here, depending on the previously set `ctx` variable, the step will run.
#### note
    the corresponding else statement would be `"{{ not ctx.should_run }}"`

### While
It is possible to specify a `while` field, with a sequence of steps that will be run until the while statement is false, e.g.:
```yaml
---
steps:
- while: "{{ ctx.count < 5 }}"
  steps:
    - calcjob: quantumespresso.pw
      inputs:
        <inputs>
      postprocess:
      - "{{ (ctx.count + 1) | to_ctx('count') }}"
```
will run the same calcjob 4 times
#### note
    Don't forget to set the ctx.count variable to something in the setup step of the workchain or the postprocessing step of the previous calcjob.

### Error
It is possible that one of the steps errors. The error code and message will always be reported by the workchain. It is also possible to explicitely specify an error to return from the workchain if this happens using:
```yaml
---
steps:
- calcjob: quantumespresso.pw
  inputs:
        <inputs>
  error:
    code: 23
    message: "The first pw calculation failed."
```
### Further examples
For a fully featured example, see the `bands.yaml` file in the examples directory which mimics largely the `PwBandsWorkchain` from the [aiida-quantumespresso](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-quantumespresso) package.
